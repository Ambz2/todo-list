# todo-list

This is a to-do list project for the ODIN project. The project features are outlined as follows:

The notes will include a title, a description, a due date, and a priority (i.e. important/urgent). Additionally, the notes tasks will also be able to be ticked off when completed, and will show with a crossed out task.

Tasks will also be able to be compacted, and expanded when one wants to see extra details about the tasks.
