# todo-list

This is a to-do list project for the ODIN project. The project features are outlined as follows:

The notes will include a title, a description, a due date, and a priority (i.e. important/urgent). Additionally, the notes tasks will also be able to be ticked off when completed, and will show with a crossed out task.

Tasks will also be able to be compacted, and expanded when one wants to see extra details about the tasks. 

Tasks will be seperated into project folders. The initial folder will be general unsorted tasks, and seperate folders that users can create. 

To-do's can also be deleted. 

-- Planning --

1. Create a template index.html, and index.css with an example static webpage for the to-do application. showcasing all of the features. This will make it easier for us to replicate everything. --DONE



2. Create a module which will allow us to take input, and produce a task object, add it to an array. This module will also manage saving this array to local storage, and upon opening the web-app it will print to console the array. It will do this for all of the project books.

3. Create a popup menu, which will allow us to create tasks.

4. Create a module which will manage the DOM related aspects of the website, including all projects. 


To - Do --

1. Popup form

2. DOM Management module
